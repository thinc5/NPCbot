# ThoughtBot

## About
A silly discord bot made using TypeScript and Node.js that uses the twitter API to request and store tweets at a specificed interval, then processes those tweets and uses a markov chain to generate a tweet of its own.

## What I've learnt
- TypeScript (I think I definatly prefer writing statically typed code!)
- Async/await and callbacks
- Node.js and npm (managing dependencies with npm and writing build, debug and prod scripts in package.json)
- Simple SQL and migrations (SQLite)
- API consumption (twitter and discord)
- Timed events (using setInterval and setTimeout)
- Dynamic/Expandable codebase at run time? (Loading all commands in a given directory as opposed to manually importing them)
- Managing and loading environment variables to keep secrets (API keys, database credentials...)
- Dealing with commercial cloud hosted virtual production environments e.g. Heorku

## Future of ThoughtBot
I am not planning to continue adding features to ThoughtBot, however I would like to continue to fix existing issues and polish exising features.
Feel free to make a pull request or issue if you feel you have anything to contribute!
