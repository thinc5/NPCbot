# ThoughtBot

## About:
A silly discord bot made using TypeScript and Node.js that uses the twitter API to request and store tweets at a specificed interval, then processes those tweets and uses a markov chain to generate a tweet of its own.

## What I've learnt!
TypeScript
Async/await and callbacks
Node.js and npm
Simple SQL and migrations (SQLite)
API consumption (twitter and discord)
Timed events
Dynamic/Expandable codebase at run time? (Loading all commands in a given directory as opposed to manually importing them)
Managing and loading environment variables to keep secrets (API keys, database credentials...)

## Future of ThoughtBot
I am not planning to continue adding features to ThoughtBot, however I would like to continue to fix existing issues and polish exising features.
Feel free to make a pull request or issue if you feel you have anything to contribute!
